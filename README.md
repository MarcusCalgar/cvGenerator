# cvGenerator

## Summary

A funny little program that creates a CV from the data provided.
This program accompanies the resume I use to apply to jobs. 

## How does it work?

The program creates the resume in the console, no GUI is available at this time. Since the formatting options in the console are limited, manual editing of the data is still required
if it is to be used in an actual resume.

### Future

The idea has a ton of potential, and it can be developed multiple ways, however, it is not scheduled right now.
